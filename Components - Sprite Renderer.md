The **Sprite Renderer** component is used for displaying sprites.

## Creating a game object with sprite renderer

Unlinke other components, there are several ways to create a game object with sprite renderer.

### Drag and drop image

The default behaviour of Unity when dropping an image into the scene is to create a game object with a sprite renderer component in it.

### Direct game object creation

1. Right click on **Hierarchy** pane.
2. Select **2D Object / Sprite**.
3. Select the game object.
4. Select the image to be used at the **Sprite** property.

### Creating an empty object

You can also create an empty object and manually add a Sprite Renderer component.
