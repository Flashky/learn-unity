Prefabs help as to create and modify a certain type of game object easily.

## Create a prefab

1. Create a folder and name it **Prefabs**.
2. Select a Game Object and drag it into the folder.

And that's it, a prefab will be created.

To create a Game Object from a prefab:
1. Go to the **Prefabs** folder.
2. Select a prefab and drag it into the Scene or into the Game Object Hierarchy.

You can tell which objects are prefabs just looking at their color at the hierarchy: they will be **blue**.

## Modify a prefab

**Modify from the prefab**

1. Go to the **Prefabs** folder.
2. Select the prefab to modify.
3. Change any of its attributes.

Any game objects created from that prefab will be modified at the same time.

**Modify from the instanced prefab**

1. Select an instanced prefab Game Object.
2. Modify its attributes.
3. Click **Overrides** and then **Apply all**.

**Note:** If you modify just one of the Game Object instances without applying, then only that instance will be modified and not all the prefab.
