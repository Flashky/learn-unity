Materials are useful for many things such as:

1. Giving friction and bounciness to Rigid bodies.
2. Create scrolling backgrounds.
3. Create improved particle systems.

## Creating a material

1. Go to **Assets** and create a folder for materials.
2. Right click on **Assets** view and select **Create / Material**.

## Assign a shader type

The shader type will determine how the material is displayed.

Examples:

- Mobile / Particles / Alpha Blended: This one allow us to use images with alpha tranparency channel, which is useful for particle systems.
- Unlit / Texture: This one is useful for creating textures.

## Assigning an image to your material

1. Go to **Assets** and select your material.
2. On the **Inspector**, click on **Albedo**.
3. Select the image you want to add to the material.
